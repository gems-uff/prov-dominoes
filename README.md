# About

Prov-Dominoes is a tool designed to explore provenance data interactively, by organizing its relationships into multiple matrices treated as dominoes. The dominoes can be visually connected to derive additional dominoes or have their contents explored through a set of matrix operations and transformations. The tool allows data combination and visualization over provenance data with GPU capabilities. Among the exploratory analysis features are: filters, Eigenvector Centrality, and Transitive Closure. Finally, the tool is compatible with the [PROV-N notation](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-n/), allowing its adoption in different domains and applications.

This project was initiated by Victor Alencar and professors Leonardo Murta and Jose Ricardo da Silva Junior during Victor's master course at Universidade Federal Fluminense.
